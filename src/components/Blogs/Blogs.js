Having a suitable laptop is so important for blogging considering all of the work is done from a computer. So having one that works well should be a top priority! While just about any laptop will do for blogging, it’s best to think of this purchase as an investment.

I get it… if you’re just starting a blog, you’re probably cautious about spending a lot of money, but it’s worth purchasing something that will last you for years to come, and will repay itself down the road.

While there are heaps of desktops out there, it’s my true belief that a laptop is the most practical option for blogging. They can go anywhere with you, allowing you to blog on the go, and they’re oftentimes more budget-friendly than some of the real fancy monitors that stay in one place forever.

The laptops on this list were chosen because of how portable, powerful, and versatile they are.

In this article, I also walk you through a few things to consider when buying a laptop for blogging, explaining them in a way that is easy to understand – even if you’re not a techy person!
